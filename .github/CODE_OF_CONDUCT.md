# Community Guidelines

## What We're About

We're building something cool together, and we want everyone to feel welcome here. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with Twitch APIs, your contributions matter.

This isn't about creating a sterile corporate environment - it's about making sure everyone can learn, share ideas, and build awesome things without dealing with unnecessary drama.

## The Basics

**Be decent to each other.** Pretty simple, right? Here's what that looks like:

- Help newcomers instead of dismissing their questions
- Disagree with ideas, not people
- Share knowledge freely and be patient with different skill levels  
- Own up to mistakes - we all make them
- Remember there's a real person behind every username

**Don't be that person who:**
- Talks down to others or acts like a know-it-all
- Makes inappropriate jokes or comments
- Harasses people publicly or privately
- Shares someone's personal info without permission
- Turns technical discussions into personal attacks

## When Things Go Wrong

Look, conflicts happen. People have bad days. If someone's being problematic, here's how we handle it:

**First time issues:** We'll have a friendly chat about what went wrong. Most problems get sorted out this way.

**Repeat offenders:** You'll get a clear warning about what needs to change. If you can't work with others respectfully, you might need a break from community spaces.

**Serious problems:** Harassment, doxxing, or other harmful behavior gets you removed immediately. Life's too short to deal with that nonsense.

## Getting Help

If someone's making the community unpleasant for you, reach out to snifo@mail.com. I'll look into it and handle things fairly. Your privacy matters - I won't broadcast your concerns to everyone.

## The Real Talk

This community exists because we all love working with Twitch's platform and helping each other build better tools. Let's keep it that way by treating each other like the humans we are.

No corporate speak, no walking on eggshells - just good people doing good work together.
