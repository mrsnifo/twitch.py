# Welcome to twitch.py

twitch.py is a modern, async-first Python library for building Twitch bots and applications with full EventSub support, Helix API access, and built-in OAuth management.

!!! tip "New here?"
    Jump straight to the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md) and get a bot running in minutes.

## Why twitch.py?

Twitch offers two main systems for developers:

- **Helix API** for querying channel info, streams, users, and more
- **EventSub** for receiving real-time events like follows, subscriptions, and chat messages

## Key Features

- **Async-first** design that uses `async` / `await` for high-performance bots
- **Auto-reconnect** feature that manages dropped connections smoothly
- **OAuth management** with token refresh and multi-user auth included 
- **Rate limit handling** so you don't need to worry about hitting API limits
- **Full type hints** for excellent IDE support and autocompletion
